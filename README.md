## Deployment

Before deploying, you first need to make sure the `homepage` key in your
`package.json` is pointing to the correct value. It should be the url of your

To deploy you should first make sure you are on the `master` branch with a
clean working directory, then you can run `npm run deploy` and wait to see if
it runs successfully.
