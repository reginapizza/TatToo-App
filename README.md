## **Tat, Too: Your Personal Tattoo Gallery App**.
------------------------------------------------------

**Hello! Thank you for taking the time to check out my app! This app was created because I love tattoos and looking at them online makes me really happy. After getting my most recent tattoo, I noticed that I had a slight reaction to the brand of ink I got and I thought that for my next one, I would like to have the artist probably use a different brand of ink, except since this was a couple months after the fact, I had no idea what type of ink the artist had used. I also realized that while some people only stick to one tattoo artist for all of their tattoos, many people with multiple tattoos have different artists (like myself) and I want a way to keep track of all of them so when people ask me about them I can just pull out my app and see the info all about it!**

### **User Stories:**

1. As a user, I want to be able to sign up, sign-in, change password, and sign out.

2. As a user, I want to be able to create a record of a new tattoo I got with inputs for a title, a description, the date I got it, the tattoo shop I got it at, the area of my body I got it on, and a link to a picture of it.

3. As a user, when adding a location for a tattoo I would like my input field to autocomplete with shop names by integrating with Google Maps API.

2. As a user, I want to be able to edit my tattoo posts.

3. As a user, I want to be able to delete one of my tattoo posts.

4. As a user, I want to be able to see all of my tattoos posts in one place.

5. As a user, I want to be able to search for tattoos based on where they are on the body.

6. As a user, I want to be able to see all user's tattoos posts when I log in (almost like a newsfeed style).

7. As a user, I want the website to visually appealing and easy to navigate.


### **Planning Story:**


### **Problems I Ran Into:**


### **Future Updates:**

1. I would really like user's to be able to 'heart'/'like' tattoo posts and have that save them to a collection that is only viewable to that user.
